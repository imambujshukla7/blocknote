# BlockNote: Decentralized Note-Taking App

BlockNote is a decentralized note-taking platform that leverages blockchain technology, specifically Motoko, to provide users with a secure and tamper-resistant platform for creating and managing notes. The application ensures a high level of security and trust in the integrity of the notes by storing them on the blockchain, making it decentralized and resistant to unauthorized alterations.

## Features

- **Decentralized Storage:** BlockNote uses blockchain technology to store notes in a decentralized manner, ensuring tamper-resistant and secure data storage.

- **Immutable Notes:** Once a note is created, it becomes immutable, meaning it cannot be altered or deleted by unauthorized parties.

- **Simplified Note-Taking:** BlockNote combines the simplicity of a note-taking application with the added benefits of decentralized and immutable storage.
